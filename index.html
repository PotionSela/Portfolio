            <h5>Early Beginnings:</h5>
            <p>Gisela Mata, a native of San Francisco, spent her formative years in the vibrant heart of the city until
                the age of 8. At that point, her family embarked on a journey to Maine, seeking a new beginning and
                fresh opportunities. During her summers, Gisela immersed herself in the enchanting wilderness of
                Augusta, Maine, at an all-girls sleep-away camp known as Camp Chewonki. Over six memorable summers, from
                the age of 11 to 17, she delved into the beauty of nature and honed her skills for living in the wild.
                Her time at Camp Chewonki not only deepened her appreciation for the preciousness of nature but also
                fostered lifelong friendships that continue to enrich her journey.</p>
